# Artificial Pancreas System â€“ Week 2 Unit Testing

This project is a simplified prototype of an Artificial Pancreas System, built with Python.  
It simulates how glucose levels respond to meals and exercise, and how insulin delivery can help maintain balance.

# Features
- Simulates glucose changes after meals and exercise
- Predicts actions: `deliver_insulin`, `warn_low_glucose`, or `maintain`
- Tracks total insulin delivered
- Prevents glucose from dropping below a safe minimum
- Includes **pytest unit tests** for correctness and stability
